# 📊 Student Performance Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a Multiple Linear Regression model to predict a student’s Performance Index based on academic and behavioral features.

The goal of the project is to understand how different factors influence student performance and evaluate the effectiveness of a regression-based predictive model.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Given the following features:

- Hours Studied  
- Previous Scores  
- Sleep Hours  

The task is to predict the student’s Performance Index using a supervised machine learning approach.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

---

## 📂 Project Workflow

1. Data Loading and Cleaning  
2. Feature Selection  
3. Train-Test Split (80-20)  
4. Model Training using Linear Regression  
5. Model Evaluation (R², MSE, RMSE)  
6. Visualization (Actual vs Predicted Plot)  
7. Interactive User Prediction

## 📈 Model Performance

Evaluation Metrics Used:

- R² Score  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  

Results:

- R² Score ≈ 0.98  
- RMSE ≈ 2  

The high R² score indicates that the model explains approximately 98% of the variance in student performance.  
The low RMSE suggests that predictions are very close to actual values.

---

## 📊 Visualization

The project includes an Actual vs Predicted scatter plot to visually evaluate model performance.

If prediction points align closely with the diagonal line, it confirms good model accuracy.
